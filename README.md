## About The Project

This project showcases a Python-based application that streamlines the process of handling PAN Card images and their associated metadata. When the application is executed, it diligently monitors a designated directory, actively searching for any new PAN Card images that may have been added. Upon detecting image(s), it seamlessly converts them to base64 representation, optimizing its compatibility for subsequent processing.

The application harnesses the immense capabilities of IDfy's PAN OCR API, a cutting-edge solution that leverages advanced optical character recognition technology specifically tailored for PAN Cards. By integrating this API into the workflow, the application retrieves comprehensive and accurate metadata from the PAN Card images, extracting key details such as name, date of birth, PAN number, and more.

With the extracted metadata in hand, the application proceeds to store this valuable information in a secure and efficient database. This enables streamlined access, retrieval, and management of PAN Card data, promoting enhanced organizational efficiency and minimizing manual data entry errors. Additionally, it archives the processed images into a separate designated folder.

## Built With

- Python: The application is developed using the Python programming language, leveraging its versatility and extensive libraries to ensure efficient and reliable functionality.
- PlanetScale: The metadata extracted from the PAN Card images is stored in a secure and scalable manner using the PlanetScale managed serverless MySQL platform. This robust database solution ensures data integrity and provides seamless access to stored information.
- Docker: The entire application is packaged and deployed using Docker, allowing for easy distribution and consistent execution across different environments. Docker ensures portability and simplifies the deployment process, enhancing the application's reliability and maintainability.

This well-organized combination of Python, PlanetScale, and Docker forms the backbone of the project, enabling a seamless and efficient workflow for processing PAN Card images, extracting metadata, and storing it in a reliable database system.

#### Walkthrough

You can watch the complete walkthrough video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0L3-7YoL_s&t=2s).

In this walkthrough example, I will demonstrate the steps involved in using the pre-built Docker image of the application.

1. Creating the required directories: Inside the **Downloads** folder, I have already set up the **pan-card-new-images** directory with a sample PAN card image, and the **pan-card-archived-images** directory is empty.

   ![Creating the required directories](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tirthyakamaldasgupta/pan-card-utility/main/examples/walkthrough/images/1.%20Folders%20created.png)

2. Setting up the environment variables: I have stored the required environment variables in a **.env** file located in my home directory.

   ![Setting up the environment variables](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tirthyakamaldasgupta/pan-card-utility/main/examples/walkthrough/images/2.%20Environment%20variables.png)

3. Database table state: The **pan_card_details** table in the PlanetScale hosted database currently does not contain any rows.

   ![Empty database table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tirthyakamaldasgupta/pan-card-utility/main/examples/walkthrough/images/3.%20Current%20empty%20state%20of%20PlanetScale%20database%20table.png)

4. Docker image creation: I have already created the required Docker image on my system.

   ![Docker image created](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tirthyakamaldasgupta/pan-card-utility/main/examples/walkthrough/images/4.%20Docker%20image.png)
